# Light control using telegram Arduino

This basic unit controls the led on and off using telegram (a greate substitute to whatsapp).
In telegram we need to create a bot and send the commands using the bot to switch on/off the appliance. 

Using a relay it can easily be scaled to control any home appliance.
